BR-SANDBOX

Brief description: BR-SANDBOX is just a simple Zend Framework Project (v. 1.11) with some 
sample code and tools setup of ease of use on later project. 

Im initlializing compontents such as:
 * Zend_Log
 * ZFDebug
 * Layout
 * Zend_Test

Also Im making few libraries of my own for later use.

For the time I'm writing this, it's only an private, test project to learn Git and ZF bit more.
It could evolve to something like BR-Framework with will be extendet ZF framework with some
custom libraries and ready
